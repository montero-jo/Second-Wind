            The production of clean wind energy has grown at an exponential rate over the last 30 or so years. As we strive towards solving the crimate crisis, we can find an optimistic light in the progression of efficient clean energy.
            Back in the late 90s, it was estimated that, by the year 2020, a single wind turbine would only be able to produce about 20 GW/y of total clean energy. We managed to beat that prediction by about 3155%– as the current standing for a single wind turbine’s energy production is around 651 GW/y.
            With this "time machine", I hope to visualize the incredible growth of renewable wind energy over the last 30 years alongside a projection of how much it's estimated to grow.

            <br>To explain the visual you find on the left, take in mind that each one of those squares represents the around 150 houses's worth of energy needs that era's respective wind turbine could power within an hour of function. </br>
