            The efficiency of clean wind energy generation has been growning at an exponential rate over the last 30 or so years. 
            As the fight against climate change and its sources continues, we can find an optimistic light in the progression of renewable energies.
           
            <br></br>

            The visual on your left represents an increase in the production efficiency of wind turbines since the 1990s. 
            Each one of the squares represents 150 houses' electricity needs being met for around a month. Take in mind that, for the most part,
            this is generated <em>within an hour</em> or so of function. 

            Back in the late 90s, it was estimated that, by the year 2020, a single wind turbine would only be able to produce about 20 GW/y of total clean energy. 
            We managed to beat that prediction by about 3155%, as the current standing for a single wind turbineâ€™s energy production is around 651 GW/y.
            With this "time machine", I hope to visualize the incredible growth of renewable wind energy over the last 30 years alongside a projection of how much it's estimated to grow.
